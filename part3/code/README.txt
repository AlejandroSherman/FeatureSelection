CS170 Feature Selection With Nearest Neighbor Project
Full Submission - Putting it all together
Hard Deadline: Sunday, June 13th, 2021

All my project code is inlcuded in main.py.
Along with my implementation code, there are also the four provided test dataset files:
My specific datasets given:
cs170_small92.txt 
cs170_large92.txt  
Sample sets given:      
cs170_small80.txt 
cs170_large80.txt
         
The project can be ran with python3 main.py.
While running, type in the name of the file to test each. 
(After one file is inserted the program runs until done. To run again with another file/algorithm pair, main.py needs to be ran again.)
Both forward selection and backwards elimination are implemented. I never implemented my own special search algorithm, so picking option 3 
when asked which algorithm to run will end the program early.

The results from the program for each dataset/algorithm can be found in the report pdf, as well as its own results.pdf (a file containing specifically just
the best features and accuracies for each dataset and algorithm combination).

Traces for each dataset/algorithm can be found in their own .txt files as such:
The forward and backward traces for my small 92 dataset can be found at the end of the report, and here in this directory in .txt files.
Extra traces (large 92 dataset and traces for the sample datasets can be found in the "extra_traces" folder.
The trace format follows: 
cs_170 size type algorithm       trace
cs_170_small92_forward_selection_trace.txt   etc...
