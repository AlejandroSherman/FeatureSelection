Please wait while I normalize the data...
Done!

Time to normalize is 0.0023190975189208984 seconds

Time to evaluate (including finding nearest neighbor) is 0.013391494750976562 seconds

Running nearest neighbor with the hardcoded features: [3, 5, 7] using leave one out evaluation, I get an accuracy of 89.0%.
