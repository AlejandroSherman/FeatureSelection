Please wait while I normalize the data...
Done!

Time to normalize is 0.012079477310180664 seconds

Time to evaluate (including finding nearest neighbor) is 0.7848281860351562 seconds

Running nearest neighbor with the hardcoded features: [1, 15, 27] using leave one out evaluation, I get an accuracy of 95.0%.
