CS170 Feature Selection
Part 2 - Implementing the actual evaluation function and NN-classifier
Soft deadline 2: Friday, June 4th, 2021

My code for part 2 is inlcuded in main.py.
Along with my part2 code, there are also the two provided test dataset files:
cs170_small80.txt
cs170_large80.txt


Part2 can be ran with python3 main.py
While running, type in the name of the file to test each. 
(After one file is inserted the program runs until done. To run the other file, part2 needs to be ran again.)

A trace for the output for the small and large datasets, with real evaluation and NNclassifer are included in their own .txt files.
